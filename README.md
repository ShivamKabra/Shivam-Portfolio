# [Project 1:- Image-Denoising-Using-CNN](https://github.com/ShivamKabra/Image-Denoising-Using-CNN.git)
I've built a deep-learning model utilizing autoencoders to enhance noisy images by generating clear, noise-free counterparts. 
With extensive training and optimization, my model transforms noisy inputs into visually appealing, crisp images. 
This innovative solution has the potential to significantly improve image quality across domains such as photography, medical imaging, and computer vision applications.

# [Project 2:- Document-Forgery-Detection](https://github.com/ShivamKabra/Document-Forgery-Detection.git)
This project involves the development and implementation of a deep-learning model for image forgery detection. The model utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), autoencoders, and spatial attention mechanisms to enhance its performance in detecting forged regions in images. The model architecture consists of an encoder network that captures high-level features and a decoder network that reconstructs the input image.


# [Project 3:- Multiple-Disease-Prediction-in-Plants](https://github.com/ShivamKabra/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-in-Plants.git)
Designing a CNN model to predict diseases in plants 
This project employs deep learning techniques to predict and classify crop diseases. The objectives include detecting unhealthy plant leaf regions, analyzing them, and accurately classifying diseases using various features. To enhance accuracy, the project emphasizes training the algorithm on large datasets. The goal is to provide a valuable tool for early disease detection in crops, enabling improved agricultural practices and higher crop yields.
